# 🍜 JoshBot 🍜

I would like a good bowl of ramen.

## What is this?

JoshBot is a Discord bot built in Python. It functions exclusively through slash commands.

## What does it do?

v1.0.0 - Currently serves as The Movie Wheel™️. It also has a few joke commands specific to the people in my friends' Discord server.

## What is The Movie Wheel ™️ ?

Two of my friends had a recurring movie night, where they would put a big list of movies they both wanted to watch on a wheel and then spin it to randomly determine what they would watch that night. All three Kizumonogatari movies were on that wheel. It was truly the best.

Anyway, they asked me if I could make something like that but for the entire friend group. This is that. Users can interact with it using the following commands...

> /help - Lists out all helpful commands.
>
> /submit [movie] - Add a movie to the wheel. You get up to two entries.
>
> /delete [number] - Delete a movie you've added to the wheel. This only works on movies that haven't already been seen.
>
> /check - Publicly prints out all movies left on the wheel without revealing who submitted what movie.
>
> /spin - Spins the wheel to get a movie to watch. It is then "removed" from the wheel, and can't be chosen again.
> 
> * A little note: the wheel is biased towards people from whom we haven't seen any movies yet.
>
> /something_cool - Marcus asked for this.

And more!

## How was it made?
Most of this code was based off the tutorials, example code, and documentation on [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), which is a really great site. I knew basically nothing about making a Discord bot with slash commands, and then was able to code the bulk of this and test it within 6 hours one random night. Making the shitty art in `media/` took longer than that. I highly recommend discord.py for beginners.


## How do I submit feature requests?

How are you even looking at this README? Anyway, you can just ask me if you want me to do something. I'll do it if it seems cool. 

## Can I copy the code?

Feel free, as long as you don't use my user ID in some nefarious way. You could probably make all of this yourself without my help.

## Can I copy the art?

Make your own! It's more fun that way.
